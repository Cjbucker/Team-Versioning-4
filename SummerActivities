Chris Bucker:
This summer I had spent most of my time relaxing and learning some new skills outside of coding. Due to the ongoing pandemic I lost any opportunity to get an internship
so I decided to learn some kitchen skills. I learned how to make various types of foods from scratch, such as pizza. I also began learning how to bake, my favourite
being oatmeal cookies from scratch. It was a lot of fun to get my mind off the chaos going on in the world and learn a new skill.

This summer I was supposed to have an internship but I ended up losing the opportunity due to COVID. To make up for it, I decided to enroll in several Udemy courses to sharpen
my coding skills. I took courses involving Linux administration, website hacking, building apps with Python, privacy and anonymity, network hacking, etc. Honestly I enjoyed it
a lot because I was learning things that I genuinely wanted to learn. Aside from computers, I worked at Taco Bell, hung out with my friends and girlfriend, and just took some
time to relax and unwind from the hectic spring semester.
