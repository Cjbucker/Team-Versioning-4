Chris Bucker:
This summer I had spent most of my time relaxing and learning some new skills outside of coding. Due to the ongoing pandemic I lost any opportunity to get an internship
so I decided to learn some kitchen skills. I learned how to make various types of foods from scratch, such as pizza. I also began learning how to bake, my favourite
being oatmeal cookies from scratch. It was a lot of fun to get my mind off the chaos going on in the world and learn a new skill.
